# CPIO
Java methods for GPIO access on CHIP
#### This class is currently functional as I am still actively developing it. Support is welcomed! ####
### Goal ###
GPIO access for Python is great, I don't particularly like Python though. My goal here is to make a super simple to use set of methods that allows GPIO programming with Java on the CHIP computer by Next Thing Co.
### Setup ###
Download the CPIO.java file, This class contains the required methods. To use this in a project, just place CPIO.java into the project directory.
